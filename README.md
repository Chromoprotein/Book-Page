A book-tracking app for my React practice

Features:
- Uploading, editing, and deleting books you've read
- User authentication
- Sorting, searching, and filtering books
- Pagination
- Open Library book and book cover APIs
- Mobile responsive
- Some accessibility features

Tech stack:
- React
- Tailwind
- Node.js / Express
- MongoDB

TO DO:
Important:
- Add a nicer error page
- Don't show a blank page when the user logs out
- Remove or shorten some timeouts that aren't useful anymore
- Force stronger passwords
- Modify alphabetical sorting so it uses the author's last name instead of first name, and ignores a / an / the in title sorting
Can wait:
- Add a spinner instead of the "loading" text
- Make the footer links point to something
If I have too much free time:
- Replace the ugly AI assets
- Add genre-based placeholder images for books without covers
